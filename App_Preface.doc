Title: Task Manager API

Description: Create a RESTful web service that allows users to manage their tasks and to-do lists.
Database : Task Manager API
Table : Users, ToDo List, Task

Components and Features:

1.  User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints. Users should be able to register, 
           login, and manage their own tasks.

2.  Task CRUD Operations: Design API endpoints to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for tasks. Each task should have properties such as title,
          description, due date, priority, and status.

3.  Task Filtering and Sorting: Implement endpoints to filter and sort tasks based on different criteria, such as priority, due date, or status.

4.  Task Assignments: Allow users to assign tasks to themselves or other users. Implement endpoints to handle task assignments and provide the ability to view 
         tasks assigned to a specific user.

5. Categories and Tags: Enable users to categorize tasks and add tags for better organization. Implement endpoints to manage task categories and tags.

6. Notifications: Provide notifications for task deadlines or updates. Users should be able to receive notifications through email, SMS, or push notifications.

7.   Database Integration: Set up a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store task data. Design the database schema and establish proper 
       relationships between entities.

8. API Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation for the API, including endpoint details, request/response formats, and authentication 
    requirements.

9.  Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and provide meaningful error messages for different scenarios, such as validation failures or unauthorized 
        access attempts.

 10.  Testing and Deployment: Write unit tests for the API endpoints and ensure code coverage. Deploy the web service to a server or a cloud platform 
 			(e.g., Heroku, AWS) for accessibility.

11.  Remember to consider best practices for RESTful API design, such as using proper HTTP methods, following naming conventions, and ensuring idempotency 
		and resource representation consistency.
